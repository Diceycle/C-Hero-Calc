// Ideally that would work for any battle. Unfortunately as Abilities grew more complex the amount of data needing to be saved outweigh the benefit of not having to run the fight again.

// So the data in here can't be used if f.e. a BUFF hero is added to the Army
// Similarly some Abilities like Valkyrie produce a Fight state that can't be efficiently captured in a FightResult.
// If one of those heroes is in an Army its FightResult is always invalid
